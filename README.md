One particular strength of the code is its clear organization and structure. The code is divided into logical sections, making it easy to understand the purpose and flow of each part. It also uses industry standard variable naming conventions to make it more readable. As it stands, the code assumes correct input by the user. To enhance the code and/or make it more secure, I could have used input validation to handle erroneous input, such as a try-catch block with an exception handler for invalid user input. To overcome challenges, I used youtube, stackoverflow, and tutoring resources when I got stuck. The most challenging part of the code was string formatting; getting code to look beautiful with spacing and setting field widths was a skill we learned in the Python course, so this was a great refresher. This project showcases the ability to handle user input, perform calculations, and show formatted output. These skills are essential to diverse projects and coursework that involve tasks such as data processing, financial calculations, and user interactions. To make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable I aimed to structure the code in a logical, intuitive way.
